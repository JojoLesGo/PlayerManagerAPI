This is a ASP.NET 8 Minimal API with a Vite + React Front-End

The API is fully useable through the client and the user can:  
  Add new players to the repository(easily expandable to a database of choice)  
  Add 100 Random Players(For testing mainly)  
  Move players from the list to the assembled team  
  Delete players from the repository  
  Assemble the best team based on the positions and the skill preferences selected  
  
I hope you enjoy the application and if you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out to me at jkeller152@gmail.com!
